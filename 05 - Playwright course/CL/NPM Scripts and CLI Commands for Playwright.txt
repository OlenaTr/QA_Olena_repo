 NPM Scripts

Add these scripts to your `package.json` file for easier execution:

json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npx playwright test",
    "test:headed": "npx playwright test --headed",
    "test:debug": "npx playwright test --debug",
    "report": "npx playwright show-report",
    "trace:retain": "npx playwright test --trace retain-on-failure",
    "trace:on": "npx playwright test --trace on",
    "update-snapshots": "npx playwright test --update-snapshots",
    "install-deps": "npx playwright install-deps"
  }
}


 CLI Commands

Here are some useful CLI commands for running and managing Playwright tests:

1. Run all tests:
   sh
   npx playwright test
   

2. Run tests in headed mode:
   sh
   npx playwright test --headed
   

3. Run tests with debug mode:
   sh
   npx playwright test --debug
   

4. Show the test report:
   sh
   npx playwright show-report
   

5. Run tests with tracing enabled (for all tests):
   sh
   npx playwright test --trace on
   

6. Run tests with tracing enabled (retain trace for failed tests only):
   sh
   npx playwright test --trace retain-on-failure
   

7. Run tests with tracing enabled (for retries only):
   sh
   npx playwright test --trace retry-with-trace
   

8. Update snapshots:
   sh
   npx playwright test --update-snapshots
   

9. Install dependencies (browser binaries, etc.):
   sh
   npx playwright install-deps
   

10. Run a specific test file:
    sh
    npx playwright test path/to/your/test-file.spec.ts
    

11. Run tests with a specific project (e.g., chromium, firefox, webkit):
    sh
    npx playwright test --project=chromium
    

12. Run tests with a specific grep filter (e.g., by tag):
    sh
    npx playwright test --grep @yourTag
    

 Combining Options

You can combine multiple options to customize your test runs further. For example, to run tests in headed mode with tracing enabled only for failed tests, use:

sh
npx playwright test --headed --trace retain-on-failure


 Using `playwright.config.ts`

You can also configure Playwright settings in the `playwright.config.ts` file for more control and convenience. Here's an example configuration that enables tracing and sets the default browser to Chromium:

typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    browserName: 'chromium',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure', // Options: 'on', 'off', 'retain-on-failure', 'retry-with-trace'
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { browserName: 'chromium' },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName: 'firefox' },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { browserName: 'webkit' },
    },
  ],
});
